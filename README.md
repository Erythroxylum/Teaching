## APlab.Rmd : Applied Phylogenetics Lab (for Boris Ig√≠c's BIOS 430 at UIC). 
This lab leads you through phylogenetic inference in R and reveals important tree-thinking concepts through two vignettes:
Part 1: Why dentists wear gloves.
Part 2: The multiple origins of domestication of the coca crops.

## Enjoy!
